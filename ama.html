        <p>I am the head of a small 2 hen flock. I love my wives very much! I am also a beautiful <em>technologically savvy</em> silvered feathered silkie rooster (#ChickensInTech)! </p>
        <aside> <p>It may be hard to believe, but I am a student of Computer Science! Not all of us are bird brains! Ahaha!</p></aside>
        <p>I love playing around with Mr. Dinosaur on google for fun, and my favorite <strong>FAVORITE</strong> food (even above mealworms!) are bananas! And my life goal (aside from becoming the best coder in the world) is to be the best husband I can be! If you're interested in my unique life as a coder rooster, then you are in luck! </p>

        <h2>Some questions I get a lot.</h2>
        <dl class="qa">
          <dt><strong>How old are you?</strong></dt>
          <dd>I am about 1 year old! I was adopted by my neighboor woman when I was just a just a fluffy tiny baby chick!</dd>
          <dt><strong>What breed of chicken are you?</strong></dt>
          <dd>I am a pround Silkie chicken! Fun fact! I have 6 toes unlike most other chickens.&#128521;</dd>
          <dt><strong>Are you smaller than your wives?</strong></dt>
          <dd>Yes I am--being small was hard at first. I remember Cookie was particularly mean to me--she would peck at me a lot and fuss about my height. Back then Baby just ignored me all the time. But just because I am small does not mean I am a bad provider! In fact I can put on a mean sparring match with nosy humans! (<em>Haha fragile human legs!! Fear my claws!</em>). I am also supurb at finding the best morsels of food for Baby and Cookie, and those talents of mine allowed me to sit at the head of the roost!</dd>
          <dt><strong>How did you learn to code?</strong></dt>
          <dd> As a chick used to fall asleep sitting in the lap of the neighboor's daughter while she was coding. During that time I quickly learned to pick up an understanding of code and the rest is history. <strong>#ChickensInTech</strong> </dd>
